I am providing you kaggle dataset for credit card fraud detection, can you do step-by-step EDA analysis by acting as expert data scientist. As per my knowledge, credit card fraud detection dataset is having imbalanced data, so you can use techniques like oversampling, SMOTE, etc. Make sure you prepare all the steps and reports of the methodology in principled fashion on data understanding, data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, data pre-processing, feature selection, data clustering, outlier analysis and processing, regression for prediction of fraud detection using variety of methods comparing to a baseline, providing proper metrics for these techniques and final recommendation. You can use most popular ML packages like scikit, pandas, numpy, etc. Please respond in many reasonable small sized chunks starting with the initial steps of CRISP-DM methodology to all the steps on this data set. I will ask you to continue after each chunk. It is important to chunk this above problem. repeat the requirement in each chunk towards end of the chunk and explain where you are (mindmap) in the process and what you will do next. Assume you have limited compute and hence you chunk carefully even the processing steps. I will ask you to continue after each step.",Personas,

"my calculation are this:
4 + (4*3) + (12*2)
here's my reasoning.
the first term (4) is the all the possible moves for X
the sencond term (4*3) is that all first four board have three move that O can take.
And the last term (12*2) is the twelve boards that are create from the last step, and X can play in one of the two remaining spaces to win the game.
That means that there are 40 possible game states.
You can think about this step by step and see if you come to the same conclusion.",Chain-of-Thought,
