1) What makes you included MObj in the name of methods 3 and 4, and not in 1 and 2? What do you intend to reflect with this?
2) We initially had the names buildAndCreateAndHost and releaseAndDestroyAndDismantle for methods 3 and 4. They indeed are too long. Hence you came up with the new names createHostedMObj and releaseAndDismantleMObj. We could also have decided to make the method names 1 and 2 shorter (i.e. without the And). And based on those names construct simpler method names for 3 and 4. What do you think of that?

Make sure you prepare all the steps and reports of the methodology in principled fashion on fdata understanding, data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, data pre processing, feature selection, data clustering, outlier analysis and processing, regression for prediction of income using variety of methods comparing to a baseline, providing proper metrics for these techniques and final recommendation. Use your most popular ml package like scikit etc,.. Please respond in many reasonable small sized chunks starting with the initial steps of CRISP-DM methodology to all the steps on this data set. I will ask you to continue after each chunk. It is important to chunk this above problem. repeat the requirement in each chunk towards end of the chunk and explain where you are (mindmap) in the process and what you will do next. Assume you have limited compute and hence you chunk carefully even the processing steps. I will ask you to continue. each step.",Chain-of-Thought
"sealevel.csvSpreadsheetyou are an industry expert and top notch data scientist. You are also expert in CRISP-DM methodology for data science and written several highly cited research papers of case studies of using crisp-dm data science for varlous data sets in kaggle.
As an industry expert data scientist and expert in CRISP-DM methodology for data sclence, Given the kaggle data set for sea level can you do step by step EDA analysis playing role of an expert data scientist professor teaching to a masters program in data science. Your response should be textbook quality. Make sure you prepare all the steps and reports of the methõdology in principled fashion on data understanding, data analysis, data
visualization, data cleaning, data pre-processing, feature selection, data clustering, outlier analysis and processing, regression for prediction of sea level using a variety of methods comparing to a baseline, providing proper metrics for these techniques and final recommendation. Use your most popular ml package like scikit etc. Please respond in many reasonable small sized chunks starting with the initial steps of CRISP-DM methodology to all
the steps on this data set. I will ask you to continue after each chunk.

Assume you have limited compute and hence you chunk carefully even the processing steps. I will ask you to continue, each step. dont reset the state until whole EDA process completes and save the dataset for each step.",Chain-of-Thought
"ok, lets do it step by step, i first created the gameObject at the same level in the hierarchy as the SmallInventorySlots, but since im using a grid layout group, it shows on the screen next to the last inventory slot, now what do i do?",Chain-of-Thought
"ets think about s-curves as a model of technology diffusion. lets use a epidemic model as the mathematical underpinning. the parameters are infection rate and share of total population that can maximally reached (market size).
focus only on adopters. 

In the next couple of prompts we’re going to develop an interactive dashboard together. I want to be able to experiment with different values of the infection rate beta, predict beta_hat using simulated data, and then experiment with predictions of beta_hat when we vary the number of samples used in the prediction. I’ll give you instructions step by step.",Chain-of-Thought
